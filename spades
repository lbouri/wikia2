===Introduction===
:''SPAdes'' (St. Petersburg genome assembler) is an assembler originally designed for the assembly of small genomes. It supports Illumina / IonTorrent reads, and now has an option to run hybrid assembly with long reads.

===Installation===
:'''SPAdes''' requires a linux or Mac OS system and python. \emph{SPAdes} can be downloaded as source code or pre-computed binaries.

Download ans extract binaries:

    $ wget http://spades.bioinf.spbau.ru/release3.6.0/SPAdes-3.6.0-Linux.tar.gz
    $ tar -zxf SPAdes-3.6.0-Linux.tar.gz
    $ cd SPAdes-3.6.0-Linux/bin/

Download and install source code:

    $ wget http://spades.bioinf.spbau.ru/release3.6.0/SPAdes-3.6.0.tar.gz
    $ tar -zxf SPAdes-3.6.0.tar.gz
    $ cd SPAdes-3.6.0
    $ ./spades_compile.sh

===Input data===
:''SPAdes'' supports paired-end reads, mate-pairs and unpaired reads in FASTA or FASTQ format. If available, contigs can be added as input data to enhance the assembly.

===Pipeline===
:'''SPAdes''' constructs a de-Bruijn graph from k-mers of different length. Thus, a smaller k value in low-coverage regions minimizes fragmentation, while a higher k-value in heavily covered areas reduces the number of chimeric contigs. Contigs are then deduced from the graph. Finally, long readings are used for closing gaps and identifying repeated regions.

    $ spades.py  --only-assembler --nanopore <file_name> -s <file_name> -trusted-contigs  <file_name> -o <output_dir>

:<b>only-assembler</b>: start the assembly module
:<b>nanopore</b>: long reads file
:<b>s</b>: short reads file
:<b>trusted-contigs</b>: contigs file
:<b>o</b>: Output folder

===Output data===
:SPAdes generates several files in the output folder:


:*'''scaffolds.fasta''' : scaffolds created by the assembly.
:*'''param.txt''' : list of parameters
:*'''warning.log''' : log file

The reference genome is used to evaluate the quality of the assembly, based on metrics produced by the QUAST software.

:<b># Contigs (> 1000pb)</b>:  Total number of contigs exceeding 1000 bp in the assembly.

:<b>Largest contig</b>: The length of the longest contig in the assembly.

:<b>Total length</b>: total number of bases in the assembly.

:<b>N50</b>: the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer covers at least half an assembly.

:<b># Misassembled contigs</b>: the number of positions in the contigs (breakpoints) that satisfy one of the following criteria :
:::-The left flanking sequence aligns over 1 kbp away from the right flanking sequence on the reference.
:::-Flanking sequences overlap on more than 1 kbp
:::-Flanking sequences align to different strands or different chromosomes; .

:<b>Misassembled contigs length</b>: the total number of bases in misassembled contigs.

:<b>Genome fraction</b>: the percentage of aligned bases in the reference genome.
