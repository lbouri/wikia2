==Introduction==
:''Abruijn'' is a denovo assembler, currently under development, create an A-bruijn graph from long reads.

Website : https://github.com/fenderglass/ABruijn

==Installation==
:''Abruijn'' requires an unix system and Blasr.

''Blasr'' installation:

    $ git clone git://github.com/PacificBiosciences/blasr.git blasr
    $ ./configure.py --no-pbbam HDF5_INCLUDE=f1 HDF5_LIB=f2 
    $ make blasr

''Abruijn'' installation:

    $ git clone https://github.com/fenderglass/ABruijn.git
    $ cd Abruijn
    $ make

==Input data==
:''Abruijn'' requires long reads stored in a FASTA file format, as well as the estimated coverage of long reads.

==Pipeline==
:The ''Abruijn'' software begins by pre-assembling the long erroneous reads. To do so, ''Abruijn'' constructs an A-bruijn graph from solid kmers.Then, ''Abruijn'' looks for a path in the A-bruijn graph, thus giving a pre-assembled genome with errors.
Finally, ''Abruijn'' use the ''BLASR'' alignment of the long reads against the preassembled genome in order to obtain a corrected assembly of the genome.

The following command line launch the assembly:

    $ python abruijn.py -t 8 -k 16 reads.fasta <dossier de sortie> <taux de couverture>

::<b>t</b>: number of threads
::<b>k</b>: kmer length

==Output data==
:Corrected sequences are located in a "polished.fasta" file, stored in the specified output folder.

==Assembly evaluation==
:Dataset:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Reference genome
|Escherichia coli k-12 MG1655 1 chromosome (4 641 652 pb)
|-
!Pacbio reads (P6C4)
|87497 reads corrected by Abruijn (100x coverage)
|-
!Illumina reads (MiSeq)
|16759877 reads (2x150pb)
|}

The reference genome is used to evaluate the quality of the assembly, based on metrics produced by the QUAST software.

:<b># Contigs (> 1000pb)</b>:  Total number of contigs exceeding 1000 bp in the assembly.

:<b>Largest contig</b>: The length of the longest contig in the assembly.

:<b>Total length</b>: total number of bases in the assembly.

:<b>N50</b>: the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer covers at least half an assembly.

:<b># Misassembled contigs</b>: the number of positions in the contigs (breakpoints) that satisfy one of the following criteria :
:::-The left flanking sequence aligns over 1 kbp away from the right flanking sequence on the reference.
:::-Flanking sequences overlap on more than 1 kbp
:::-Flanking sequences align to different strands or different chromosomes; .

:<b>Misassembled contigs length</b>: the total number of bases in misassembled contigs.

:<b>Genome fraction</b>: the percentage of aligned bases in the reference genome.
