==Introduction==
:''Ra'' is a de novo assembler taking only long reads as input. It has the particularity of using a new mapper named Graphmap. Nevertheless, since the development of this tool is still recent, ''Ra'' does not include a consensus stage

Website : https://github.com/mariokostelac/ra-integrate

==Installation==
:''Ra'' requires a linux system, ruby 2.2, make, g++ (4.8+) et graphviz. It is also possible to launch ''Ra'' via the use of a Docker container.

Compilation of ''Ra'':

    $ git clone--recursive https://github.com/mariokostelac/ra-integrate.git
    $ make

Start ''Ra'' in a Docker container:

    $ docker pull mariokostelac/ra-integrate:master

==Input data==
:''Ra'' only needs Long reads stored in a FASTA file format

==Pipeline==
:In order to find overlaps between the different long reads used to generated a genome assembly, Graphmap's agorithm is divided into 5 steps:

:*Reduces the search space and get seed hits as a form of coarse alignment using a novel adaptation of gapped spaced seeds.
:*Constructs anchors using a graph-based vertex-centric processing of seeds.
:*Chains anchors using a kmer version of longest common subsequence (LCSk) construction.
:*Refines alignments by chaining anchors in the anchored mode or with a form of L1 linear regression in the semiglobal alignment mode
:*Evaluates the remaining candidates to select the best location to reconstruct a final alignment

The following command line launch the assembly:

    $ script/run reads.fa

==Output data==
:The file containing the assembled sequences (FASTA) is in an output folder named "assembly.number"

==Assembly evaluation==
:Dataset:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Reference genome
|Escherichia coli k-12 MG1655 1 chromosome (4 641 652 pb)
|-
!Pacbio reads (P6C4)
|87497 reads corrected by ''Ra'' (100x coverage)
|-
!Illumina reads (MiSeq)
|16759877 reads (2x150pb)
|}

The reference genome is used to evaluate the quality of the assembly, based on metrics produced by the QUAST software.

:<b># Contigs (> 1000pb)</b>:  Total number of contigs exceeding 1000 bp in the assembly.

:<b>Largest contig</b>: The length of the longest contig in the assembly.

:<b>Total length</b>: total number of bases in the assembly.

:<b>N50</b>: the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer covers at least half an assembly.

:<b># Misassembled contigs</b>: the number of positions in the contigs (breakpoints) that satisfy one of the following criteria :
:::-The left flanking sequence aligns over 1 kbp away from the right flanking sequence on the reference.
:::-Flanking sequences overlap on more than 1 kbp
:::-Flanking sequences align to different strands or different chromosomes; .

:<b>Misassembled contigs length</b>: the total number of bases in misassembled contigs.

:<b>Genome fraction</b>: the percentage of aligned bases in the reference genome.
