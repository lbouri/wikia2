==Introduction==
:''Newbler'' is a set of scripts specifically designed for assembly from
Data generated by platforms of pyrosequencing 454 (454 Life Sciences).

Website: http://www.454.com/products/analysis-software/

==Installation==
:In order to download ''Newbler'' binary files, a link must be requested on the website by filing out a form. Then download and extract the file "gsNewbler-2.9-1x8664.rpm"

==Input data==
:''Newbler'' accepts reads larger than 2000 bp. In the case of long reads, read size exceed 2000bp and they must be truncated while maintaining a maximum of overlapping between the sequences.

==Pipeline==
:First, the project must be created:

    $ newAssembly projectname

Then, Truncated long reads can be loaded in a new project:

    $ addRun -lib minion projectname run_minion.fasta

Lastly, the following command line launch the assembly:

    $ runProject -mi 96 -ml 60 -sl 22 projectname

:<b>mi</b>: minimum percentage of identity

:<b>ml</b>: minimum overlap length

:<b>sl</b>: seed length


The first phase of the assembly consists in finding overlaps between the reads. 
First, Newbler produces 16-mer seeds for each read. When Newbler finds an overlap between two reads, it extends the overlap between
the reads up to a minimum size (40bp by default), with a minimum percentage of identity (90 by default). 

''Newbler'' then create a graph, and finally extract the contigs.

''Newbler'' can also be executed with one command line:

    $ runAssembly -o projectname -mi 96 -ml 60 -sl 22 run_minion.fasta

==Output data==
:The output folder contains the generated genome assembly in a file named "454AllContigs.fna"

==Assembly evaluation==
:Dataset:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Reference genome
|Escherichia coli k-12 MG1655 1 chromosome (4 641 652 pb)
|-
!Pacbio reads (P6C4)
|87497 reads corrected by ''Lordec'' (100x coverage)
|-
!Illumina reads (MiSeq)
|16759877 reads (2x150pb)
|}

The reference genome is used to evaluate the quality of the assembly, based on metrics produced by the QUAST software.

:<b># Contigs (> 1000pb)</b>:  Total number of contigs exceeding 1000 bp in the assembly.

:<b>Largest contig</b>: The length of the longest contig in the assembly.

:<b>Total length</b>: total number of bases in the assembly.

:<b>N50</b>: the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer covers at least half an assembly.

:<b># Misassembled contigs</b>: the number of positions in the contigs (breakpoints) that satisfy one of the following criteria :
:::-The left flanking sequence aligns over 1 kbp away from the right flanking sequence on the reference.
:::-Flanking sequences overlap on more than 1 kbp
:::-Flanking sequences align to different strands or different chromosomes; .

:<b>Misassembled contigs length</b>: the total number of bases in misassembled contigs.

:<b>Genome fraction</b>: the percentage of aligned bases in the reference genome.
