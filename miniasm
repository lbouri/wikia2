==Introduction==
: ''Miniasm'' is a Denovo assembler based on OLC algorithm. ''Miniasm'' is able to generate a genome assembly from Pacbio or Nanopore long reads, corrected or not, in a short period of time. 

It is worth mentioning that ''Miniasm'' pipeline do not contain a consensus stage nor a correction stage.

==Installation==
:''Miniasm'' can be downloaded as source code:

    $git clone https://github.com/lh3/minimap && (cd minimap && make)
    $git clone https://github.com/lh3/miniasm && (cd miniasm && make)

==Input format==
: ''Miniasm'' needs the file holding the alignment data (".paf.gz" file extension), generated by ''Minimap''. ''Minimap'' accept FASTA and FASTQ file.

==Pipeline==
: First of all, ''Minimap'' find approximate mapping positions between the long reads.

Then, ''Miniasm'' uses the file generated by ''Minimap'' to build an assembly graph in a file with extension ".gfa"

    $minimap/minimap -Sw5 -L100 -m0 -t8 reads.fq reads.fq | gzip -1 > reads.paf.gz

:<b>S</b>: Do not take into account reads that map against them

:<b>w</b>: Minimizer window length

:<b>L</b>: Minimal match length

:<b>m</b>: merge two strings if the given percentage is shared between minimizer

:<b>t</b>: Number of threads

    $miniasm/miniasm -f reads.fq reads.paf.gz > reads.gfa

==Output data==
: Finally, the following AWK script allows to convert the ".gfa" file to a FASTA file format:

    $ awk '/^S/{print ">"$2"\n"$3}' input_file.gfa | fold > output_file.fa

==Assembly evaluation==
:Dataset:

{| class="wikitable"

!Reference genome
|Escherichia coli k-12 MG1655 1 chromosome (4 641 652 pb)

The reference genome is used to evaluate the quality of the assembly, based on metrics produced by the QUAST software.

:<b># Contigs (> 1000pb)</b>:  Total number of contigs exceeding 1000 bp in the assembly.

:<b>Largest contig</b>: The length of the longest contig in the assembly.

:<b>Total length</b>: total number of bases in the assembly.

:<b>N50</b>: the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer covers at least half an assembly.

:<b># Misassembled contigs</b>: the number of positions in the contigs (breakpoints) that satisfy one of the following criteria :
:::-The left flanking sequence aligns over 1 kbp away from the right flanking sequence on the reference.
:::-Flanking sequences overlap on more than 1 kbp
:::-Flanking sequences align to different strands or different chromosomes; .

:<b>Misassembled contigs length</b>: the total number of bases in misassembled contigs.

:<b>Genome fraction</b>: the percentage of aligned bases in the reference genome.
