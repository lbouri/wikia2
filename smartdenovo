==Introduction==
:''Smartdenovo'' is a de novo assembler for PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) data. It produces a sequence consensus after aligning reads against themselves.
It doesn't have a correction stage.
Website: https://github.com/ruanjue/smartdenovo

==Installation==
:''Smartdenovo'' requires an unix system.

    $ git clone https://github.com/ruanjue/smartdenovo.git && (cd smartdenovo; make)

==Input data==
: ''Smartdenovo'' takes long reads sequences in a FASTA file format.

==Pipeline==
: ''Smartdenovo'' has several tools to find overlaps between reads, to identify the chimeric or low-quality regions, and then to construct consensus sequences. 

These tools are launched by the perl script "smartdenovo.pl".

    $ smartdenovo.pl -p prefix reads.fa > prefix.mak
    $ make -f prefix.mak

==Output data==
: The genome assembly is in the file with ".dmo.lay.utg" extension

==Assembly evaluation==

Dataset:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Reference genome
|Escherichia coli k-12 MG1655 1 chromosome (4 641 652 pb)
|-
!Pacbio reads (P6C4)

The reference genome is used to evaluate the quality of the assembly, based on metrics produced by the QUAST software.

:<b># Contigs (> 1000pb)</b>:  Total number of contigs exceeding 1000 bp in the assembly.

:<b>Largest contig</b>: The length of the longest contig in the assembly.

:<b>Total length</b>: total number of bases in the assembly.

:<b>N50</b>: the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer covers at least half an assembly.

:<b># Misassembled contigs</b>: the number of positions in the contigs (breakpoints) that satisfy one of the following criteria :
:::-The left flanking sequence aligns over 1 kbp away from the right flanking sequence on the reference.
:::-Flanking sequences overlap on more than 1 kbp
:::-Flanking sequences align to different strands or different chromosomes; .

:<b>Misassembled contigs length</b>: the total number of bases in misassembled contigs.

:<b>Genome fraction</b>: the percentage of aligned bases in the reference genome.
